pigiron/script/oorexx/functest contains a preliminary but complete
ObjectRexx scripting interface for PigIron.

To run these, you will need to install and properly configure:

    - Open ObjectRexx from http://sourceforge.net/projects/oorexx
    - BSF4Rexx http://wi.wu-wien.ac.at/rgf/rexx/bsf4rexx/

All the script files we use are of course covered by the license.txt file found
in the main or doc directory of the PigIron Project http://pigiron.sourceforge.net
