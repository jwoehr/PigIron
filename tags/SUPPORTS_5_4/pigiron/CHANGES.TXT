2008-09-01 0.4 -- release more functionality and beginning of business objects
and web objects

Added JSON source to the tree. It's small and freely licensed and easier
for a preliminary implementation of web objects.

Added the directory pigiron/script for scripts to run PigIron. There's one
example there from FIJI the ForthIsh Java Interpreter http://fiji.sourceforge.net

Functions additionally supported in this release:

    * Image_Activate
    * Image_Deactivate
    * Image_Device_Dedicate
    * Image_Device_Reset
    * Image_Device_Undedicate
    * Shared_Memory_Create
    * Shared_Memory_Delete
    * Shared_Memory_Replace
    * Virtual_Channel_Connection_Create
    * Virtual_Channel_Connection_Delete

    * Virtual_Network_Vswitch_Set
    * VMRM_Measurement_Query
    * VMRM_Configuration_Update
    * VMRM_Configuration_Query

This completes (if I've counted correctly!) all the non-DM VSMAPI calls,
though NOT ALL HAVE BEEN TESTED.

Many fixes and small changes to PigGen and the style of description files.

2008-08-27 0.3 -- release more functionality and improved autogenerator.

Functions additionally supported in this release:

    * Authorization_List_Add
    * Authorization_List_Query
    * Authorization_List_Remove
    * Image_Disk_Copy
    * Image_Disk_Create
    * Image_Disk_Delete
    * Image_Disk_Share
    * Image_Disk_Unshare
    * Image_Volume_Add
    * Image_Volume_Delete
    * Name_List_Add
    * Name_List_Destroy
    * Virtual_Network_Adapter_Query

Made a design change: VSMAPI Structure classnames etc are going to use the
string (appropriately cased) "structure" not "struct". This is an inconsistency
with the earlier code but the advantage in autogeneration of observing this
convention is overwhelming.

More documentation. More on the plan of development.

A start on a framework for business objects.

2008-08-20 0.2 -- release more functionality and release autogenerator.
Very incomplete docs, but good javadocs.

The piggen autogenerator generates Java code for VSMAPI parms and funcs
from m4 specs. It is good and sound though there are some limitations
in the present implementation, e.g., the Java names of VSMAPI Array types
must actually end in the string "Array" for them to be correctly handled
by the function autogenerator.

Functions additionally supported in this release:
    * Query_API_Functional_Level
    * Shared_Memory_Query

2008-08-17 0.1 -- release of proof of concept. Parameter composition, decomposition,
marshalling and transmission work, along with a small set of VSMAPI function
calls:
    * Image_Active_Configuration_Query
    * Image_Query_Activate_Time
    * Check_Authentication
    * Image_Status_Query
    * Name_List_Query

It's easy enough to code the calls and their parameters. I'm only releasing this
in its unfinished form so folks can see and comment.
