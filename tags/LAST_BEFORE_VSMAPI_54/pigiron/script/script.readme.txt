pigiron/script

Here is where we will put any useful and interesting scripting for PigIron
that we come up with and use for testing.

We've started with two subrirs:
    * ./fiji subdir which is scripting for PigIron in FIJI the ForthIsh Java
      Interpreter http://fiji.sourceforge.net
    * oorexx which is scripting for PigIron in Open ObjectRexx
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/oorexx


All files are of course covered by the license.txt file found in the main or doc
directory of the PigIron Project.
