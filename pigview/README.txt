PigView is the PigIron Web 2.0 Operations Navigator. It uses JSON as an
interchange format with PigLet, the PigIron Servlet to send VSMAPI requests
to Hosts and interpret the response.

PigView is built using the open source Google Web Toolkit (GWT) http://code.google.com
which you will wish to download in order to build PigView. You do not need GWT to
run PigView.
