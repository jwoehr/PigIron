The .cls files in this directory are ObjectRexx classes based on pigfunc.cls
They provide a preliminary but complete ObjectRexx interface to VSMAPI
Test via the corresponding.rex files also found in this directory.

These classes and functions have not all been run and tested, but writing
them I found numerous corrections in the Java function code mostly generated
perfectly correctly by PigGen from erroneous description files.
