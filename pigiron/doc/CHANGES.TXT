This is the PigIron project. PigIron is a library of Java class wrappers for the

Programming Interface (sometimes called VSMAPI).

CHANGES
-------

2008-08-?? 0,2 -- release more functionality. Additional VSMAPI functions added
include:
    * Query_API_Functional_Level

2008-08-17 0.1 -- release of proof of concept. Parameter composition, decomposition,
marshalling and transmission work, along with a small set of VSMAPI function
calls:
    * Image_Active_Configuration_Query
    * Image_Query_Activate_Time
    * Check_Authentication
    * Image_Status_Query
    * Name_List_Query

It's easy enough to code the calls and their parameters. I'm only releasing this
in its unfinished form so folks can see and comment.
