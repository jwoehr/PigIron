  <h1>PigIron Java Class Library for VSMAPI Programming</h1>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>

  <p>PigIron is an open source Java library implementing the client
  to <a href=
  "http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/hcsl8c24.pdf">IBM &reg;
  z/VM &reg; V6R3.0 Systems Management Application Programming</a>
  transactions over TCP/IP sockets (referred to in PigIron
  documentation as <i>VSMAPI</i>).<br></p>

  <h2>Disclaimers</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>PigIron is Open Source software and as such carries no
    warranty or guarantee whatsoever. Please read <a href=
    "#License">the License</a> below.</li>

    <li>The <a href="http://pigiron.sourceforge.net">The PigIron
    Project</a> is not associated with the <a href=
    "http://www.ibm.com">International Business Machines
    Corporation (IBM)</a>, purveyors of fine mainframes and
    mainframe operating systems, especially the <a href=
    "http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/">System Z hardware platform</a>
    and the <a href="http://www.vm.ibm.com/">z/VM Operating
    System</a>.</li>

    <li>PigIron is under development and will certainly undergo
    changes in its scope, code, documentation, implementation and
    programming interfaces.</li>

    <li><b>SECURITY (OR LACK OF)</b>: Pigiron code supports Secure
    Sockets Layer (SSL) in ts TCP/IP communications. To use SSL,
    invoke the <big><span style=
    "font-family: monospace;">doIt(boolean ssl)</span></big> method
    of any PigIron VSMAPI function with the boolean flag set to
    <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">true</span></big>.
    <b>IF YOU DO NOT USE SSL, THEN ONLY USE PIGIRON ON A SECURE
    INTRANET BEHIND A FIREWALL.</b></li>
  </ul>
