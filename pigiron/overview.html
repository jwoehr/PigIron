    <h1>PigIron Java Class Library for VSMAPI Programming</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>PigIron is a Java class library for carrying out
      <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zvm/v5r3/topic/com.ibm.zvm.v53.dmse6/hcsl8b20.htm">
      IBM &reg; z/VM &reg; V5R3.0 Systems Management Application Programming</a>
    transactions over TCP/IP sockets (hereinafter referred to as <i>VSMAPI</i>).</p>

    <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>PigIron is Open Source software and as such carries no warranty or guarantee
      whatsoever. Please read <a href="#License">the License</a> below.</li>
      <li>The <a href="http://pigiron.sourceforge.net">The PigIron Project</a> is not
        connected in any way with the <a href="http://www.ibm.com">International
        Business Machines Corporation (IBM)</a>, purveyors of fine mainframes and
        mainframe operating systems, especially the
        <a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/">System Z hardware platform</a>
        and the
      <a href="http://www.vm.ibm.com/">z/VM Operating System</a>.</li>
      <li>PigIron is under development and will certainly undergo changes in its scope,
      code, documentation, implementation and programming interfaces. Please do not make
      assumptions based on the current state of the code that are are not supported by
      assurances from the Pigiron Project!</li>
      <li><b>SECURITY (LACK OF)</b>: Pigiron code currently DOES NOT implement any sort of
      security on its TCP/IP communications. In particular, the socket connection
      currently DOES NOT support SSL (though that is a feature which is easily
      accomodated in the architecture and is planned for the future).
      <b>USE ONLY ON A SECURE INTRANET BEHIND A FIREWALL.</b>

    </ul>
