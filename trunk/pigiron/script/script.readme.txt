pigiron/script

Here is where we will put any useful and interesting scripting for PigIron
that we come up with. I've started with the ./fiji subdir which is scripting
for PigIron in FIJI the ForthIsh Java Interpreter http://fiji.sourceforge.net


All files are of course covered by the license.txt file found in the main or doc
directory of the PigIron Project.
