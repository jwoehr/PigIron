pigiron/script/oorexx

Here is where we will put any useful and interesting ObjectRexx scripting for
PigIron that we come up with.

To run these, you will need to install and properly configure:

    - Open ObjectRexx from http://sourceforge.net/projects/oorexx
    - BSF4Rexx http://wi.wu-wien.ac.at/rgf/rexx/bsf4rexx/

All the script files we use are of course covered by the license.txt file found
in the main or doc directory of the PigIron Project http://pigiron.sourceforge.net
