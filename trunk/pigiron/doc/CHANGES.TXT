CHANGES
-------
2008-08-?? 0.3 -- release more functionality and improved autogenerator.

Functions additionally supported in this release:
    * Image_Volume_Add
    * Image_Volume_Delete
    * Name_List_Add
    * Name_List_Destroy
    * Virtual_Network_Adapter_Query
    * Image_Recycle

Made a design change: VSMAPI Structure classnames etc are going to use the
string (appropriately cased) "structure" not "struct". This is an inconsistency
with the earlier code but the advantage in autogeneration of observing this
convention is overwhelming.

More documentation.

2008-08-20 0.2 -- release more functionality and release autogenerator.
Very incomplete docs, but good javadocs.

The piggen autogenerator generates Java code for VSMAPI parms and funcs
from m4 specs. It is good and sound though there are some limitations
in the present implementation, e.g., the Java names of VSMAPI Array types
must actually end in the string "Array" for them to be correctly handled
by the function autogenerator.

Functions additionally supported in this release:
    * Query_API_Functional_Level
    * Shared_Memory_Query

2008-08-17 0.1 -- release of proof of concept. Parameter composition, decomposition,
marshalling and transmission work, along with a small set of VSMAPI function
calls:
    * Image_Active_Configuration_Query
    * Image_Query_Activate_Time
    * Check_Authentication
    * Image_Status_Query
    * Name_List_Query

It's easy enough to code the calls and their parameters. I'm only releasing this
in its unfinished form so folks can see and comment.
