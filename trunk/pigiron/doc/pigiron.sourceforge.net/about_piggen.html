  Box 51, Golden, Colorado 80402-0051 USA All rights
  reserved.</tt></p>PigGen autogenerates Java source code to embody
  <a href="index.html">PigIron</a>-specific VSMAPI parameter
  structures and arrays and VSMAPI function calls for either native
  VSMAPI functions or for your own custom VSMAPI host-side
  functions.<br>
  <br>
  VSMAPI is extensible on the Host by Rexx programming. You may
  wish at sometime to extend PigIron's class library support to
  support functions you and your team members have coded on the
  Host. Supporting a new VSMAPI function in PigIron requires Java
  classes which implement the function and its parameters. PigGen
  is a macro language which will author these classes for you from
  an <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/">m4</a>-based
  description file. You do not even have to know Java beyond
  knowing how to compile everything after PigGen has autogenerated
  your code.<br>
  <br>
  You have two principal uses for PigGen:

  <ol>
    <li>You can extend PigIron as IBM adds new VSMAPI Functions
    (along with their complement of parameter structures and
    arrays) without your having to understand PigIron's Java source
    code intimately.</li>

    <li>You can extend PigIron with calls to support your own
    custom-coded host-side extensions to VSMAPI (since VSMAPI
    supports custom extension coding).</li>
  </ol>PigGen also generates FIJI source to simplify scripting
  PigIron via FIJI. <a href="http://fiji.sourceforge.net/">FIJI the
  ForthIsh Java Interpreter</a> can be used to drive or test
  PigIron. The same description files used to generate PigIron's
  own Java source code embodying VSMAPI function parameters,
  structures and functions can be interpreted by PigGen to produce
  FIJI source to make it easier to employ PigIron in a FIJI
  program, such as some of the test code accompanying PigIron.<br>
  <br>
  PigGen also generates Java source for proxy classes used by
  <a href="about_piglet.html">PigLet the PigIron Servlet</a> to
  interpret <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> strings into
  PigIron requests and responses. Again, this is from the same
  description files as those used to generate the other
  classes.<br>

  <p>PigGen is part of <a href="http://pigiron.sourceforge.net">The
  PigIron Project</a></p>
