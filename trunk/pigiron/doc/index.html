    <h1>PigIron Open Source Java Classes for VSMAPI</h1>

    <h2>Project Goal</h2>

    <p>The goal of the project is to provide Java class wrappers for
      the IBM z/VM Virtual Machine Operating System
      <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zvm/v5r3/topic/com.ibm.zvm.v53.dmse6/hcsl8b20.htm">
      Systems Management Application Programming Interface</a>
    (sometimes called VSMAPI).</p>

    <p>Additionally, there are visual widgets planned based on class embodiments
      of VSMAPI functions so that VSMAPI functions can be dragged and dropped into
      a yet-to-be-defined workspace and executed individually or in ordered collections
    as if they were scripts.</p>

    <p>Please visit <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pigiron/">
    PigIron on Source Forge</a> to download source, executable code and documentation.</p>
