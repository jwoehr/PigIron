    <h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>

    <p>The goal of the project is to provide Java class wrappers for
      the IBM z/VM Virtual Machine Operating System
      <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zvm/v5r3/topic/com.ibm.zvm.v53.dmse6/hcsl8b20.htm">
      Systems Management Application Programming Interface</a>
    (sometimes called VSMAPI).</p>

    <p><i>Note: PigIron is not associated with the IBM corporation.</i></p>

    <h3><a name="NOTE_ON_SECURITY">NOTE ON SECURITY (LACK THEREOF)</a></h3>
    <p><b>Currently there is NO secure sockets implementation. Sends your password in
    CLEAR TEXT. Use ONLY on a secure LAN behind a firewall.</b></p>

    <h3><a name="Current_Level_of_Support">Current Level of Support</a></h3>
    <p>PigIron currently supports the z/VM R5.3 level of VSMAPI.</p>
    <h3><a name="Future_Development_Plans">Future Development Plans</a></h3>
    <p>Additionally to the basic class library, there are visual widgets planned based on PigIron's class embodiments
      of VSMAPI functions so that VSMAPI functions can be dragged and dropped into
      some yet-to-be-defined workspace and executed individually or in ordered collections
    as if they were scripts.</p>
