As regards Query_All_DM ...
- directory_entry_data_structure_counted is not actually used, that was
a misunderstanding on my part as to the protocol.
- The SMAPI array called directory_entries_array is called directory_entry_array
in PigIron for reasons of how the code is autogenerated. This is more consistent
with IBM's own general naming convention for SMAPI than what they did in this
instance!
