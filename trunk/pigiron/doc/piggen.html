<h2><a name="Overview">Overview of PigIron's PigGen</a></h2>
<p>PigGen autogenerates Java source code to embody <a href="index.html">PigIron</a>-specific
VSMAPI parameter structures and arrays and VSMAPI function calls for
either native VSMAPI functions or for your own custom VSMAPI host-side
functions.</p>
<p>You have two uses for PigGen: </p>
<ol>
  <li>You can extend PigIron as IBM adds new VSMAPI Functions (along
with their complement of parameter structures and arrays) without your
having to understand PigIron's Java source code intimately.</li>
  <li>You can extend PigIron with calls to support your own
custom-coded host-side extensions to VSMAPI (since VSMAPI supports
custom extension coding). </li>
</ol>
<h3>Interesting Conversational Snippet on the Why of PigGen</h3>
<blockquote> (10:08:15) Dave Jones: looking at class VSMCall....this is
beginning to make sense..<br>
(10:09:46) Uncle Jax: Right, that's the base from which all funct calls
are extended. Class commonality. But DESIGN PATTERN COMMONALITY e.g.,
each VSMAPI FUnction class layout of composeInput() and composeOutput()
is not subject to inheritance factoring .. the commonality is more
easily expressed in m4 macros.<br>
(10:10:03) Dave Jones: OK<br>
(10:10:18) Uncle Jax: Makes up for Java not having templates like C++
does.<br>
