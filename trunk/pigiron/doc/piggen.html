    <h1>PigGen Paramstruct Java AutoGenerator</h1>

    <h2>Overview of PigIron's PigGen</h2>
    <p>PigGen autogenerates Java source code to embody PigIron-specific
      VSMAPI parameter structures for either native VSMAPI calls or for your own
      custom coding (assuming that someone is custom coding the VSMAPI host side
    that will answer your custom function calls).</p>
