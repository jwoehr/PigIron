    <h1>PigGen Paramstruct Java AutoGenerator</h1>

    <h2>Overview of PigIron's PigGen</h2>
    <p>PigGen autogenerates Java source code to embody PigIron-specific
      VSMAPI parameter structures for either native VSMAPI calls or for your own
      custom coding (assuming that someone is custom coding the VSMAPI host side
    that will answer your custom function calls).</p>

    <h3>Interesting Conversational Snippet on the Why of PigGen</h3>
    <blockquote>
      (10:08:15) Dave Jones: looking at class VSMCall....this is beginning to make sense..<br>
      (10:09:46) Uncle Jax: Right, that's the base from which all funct calls are extended.
      Class commonality. But DESIGN PATTERN COMMONALITY e.g., each VSMAPI FUnction class
      layout of composeInput() and composeOutput() is not subject to inheritance factoring
      .. the commonality is more easily expressed in m4 macros.<br>
      (10:10:03) Dave Jones: OK<br>
      (10:10:18) Uncle Jax: Makes up for Java not having templates like C++ does.<br>
