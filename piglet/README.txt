This is release 0.9.7 of Piglet.
PigLet is the PigIron Servlet. It accepts JSON string descriptions of PigIron VSMAPI
functions, interprets and executes the requests, and returns the results in JSON format.
You may encounter difficulty building this code, though it does build and work. Functionality
designed to enhance the ease is planned.
